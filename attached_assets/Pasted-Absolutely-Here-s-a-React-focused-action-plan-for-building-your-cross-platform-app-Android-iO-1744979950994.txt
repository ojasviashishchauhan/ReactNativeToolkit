Absolutely! Here’s a **React-focused action plan** for building your cross-platform app (Android, iOS, and web) with all the features you described. This plan is tailored for a React/React Native stack, leveraging open-source tools and best practices.

# Action Plan: Activity-Sharing App with React & React Native

## 1. **Tech Stack Selection**

- **Mobile:** [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) (for Android/iOS)
- **Web:** [React](https://react.dev/) (with [React Native for Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/))
- **Maps:** [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps) (with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) tiles via [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/) or [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/))
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (API), or Firebase for rapid prototyping
- **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose), or Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication:** JWT (custom) or Firebase Auth
- **Real-time Chat:** [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) (for custom backend) or Firebase Realtime Database
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit or React Context API
- **Notifications:** [Expo Notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/overview/) (for mobile) or web push

---

## 2. **Project Structure & Setup**

### 2.1. **Monorepo Setup**
- Use [Nx](https://nx.dev/) or [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) to manage shared code (components, utilities) between web and mobile.

### 2.2. **Initialize Projects**
- `npx create-react-native-app` for mobile.
- `npx create-react-app` or Next.js for web.
- Set up shared UI library for maximum code reuse.

---

## 3. **Core Feature Implementation**

### 3.1. **Authentication & User Profiles**
- Email/password and social login (Google/Apple).
- Profile page: avatar, bio, reviews, activities hosted/joined.

### 3.2. **Map & Activity Discovery**
- Integrate OpenStreetMap with `react-native-maps` (mobile) and [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) (web).
- Show user’s location (with permissions).
- Fetch and display activity markers within a user-settable radius (default: 2km).
- Activity marker click → show summary card/modal.

### 3.3. **Activity Hosting**
- Form to create activity: title, description, type, date/time, max participants, general location (picked on map).
- Save activity to backend.
- Show hosted activities on user profile.

### 3.4. **Join Requests**
- "Request to join" button on activity details.
- Host receives notification and can approve/reject.
- Upon approval: reveal exact location and create/join chat room.

### 3.5. **Chat Room**
- Create chat room for each activity (using Socket.io or Firebase).
- Only approved participants can access.
- Real-time messaging, emoji support, and basic moderation.

### 3.6. **Reviews**
- After activity, prompt users to rate/review each other.
- Reviews appear on user profiles.
- Aggregate rating displayed.

---

## 4. **Backend API Design**

### 4.1. **Core Endpoints**
- `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/me`
- `/users/:id`, `/users/:id/reviews`
- `/activities` (GET, POST)
- `/activities/:id` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- `/activities/:id/join` (POST)
- `/activities/:id/participants` (GET, PUT)
- `/chat/:activityId` (GET, POST)

### 4.2. **Database Schema (Mongoose Example)**

```js
// User
{
  _id,
  username,
  email,
  avatar,
  bio,
  reviews: [{ reviewerId, rating, comment, activityId, createdAt }],
  createdAt,
}

// Activity
{
  _id,
  hostId,
  title,
  description,
  type,
  location: { lat, lng, address, exactLocation },
  dateTime,
  capacity,
  participants: [{ userId, status }], // status: pending/approved/rejected
  isActive,
  createdAt,
}

// Chat
{
  activityId,
  messages: [{ senderId, content, createdAt }]
}
```

## 5. **Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Foundation**
- Set up monorepo, initialize web/mobile apps, configure shared components.
- Set up backend API and database.

### **Phase 2: Authentication & Profiles**
- Implement user registration/login.
- Build profile page and edit functionality.

### **Phase 3: Map & Activity System**
- Integrate maps, show user location.
- Fetch and display activities as markers.
- Activity creation and details.

### **Phase 4: Social Features**
- Join request flow and notifications.
- Chat room integration.
- Review/rating system.

### **Phase 5: Polish & Launch**
- Responsive UI, accessibility, error handling.
- Push notifications.
- Testing (unit, integration, e2e).
- Deploy backend (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Vercel), web, and mobile (App Store, Play Store).

---

## 6. **Sample Tasks for Cursor AI**

- Scaffold React Native + React web apps with shared codebase.
- Implement OpenStreetMap in both mobile and web using appropriate libraries.
- Build authentication flow with JWT or Firebase.
- Create Activity model and API endpoints.
- Implement join request logic and notification system.
- Set up Socket.io server and integrate chat rooms.
- Design and implement review system with profile integration.
- Ensure mobile/web UI consistency and responsiveness.

---

## 7. **Tips & Best Practices**

- Use [Expo](https://expo.dev/) for easier React Native development and push notifications.
- Leverage TypeScript for type safety across web and mobile.
- Modularize code for easy maintenance and scaling.
- Prioritize security: never expose exact locations until approved, validate all API inputs, and use HTTPS.
- Regularly test on both mobile platforms and web for consistent UX.

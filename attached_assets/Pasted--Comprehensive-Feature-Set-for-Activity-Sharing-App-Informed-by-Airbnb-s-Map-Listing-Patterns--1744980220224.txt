# Comprehensive Feature Set for Activity-Sharing App  
**Informed by Airbnb's Map/Listing Patterns & Playo's Social Features**  

---

## I. Core Map & Activity Discovery System (Airbnb-inspired)  
### 1. **Intelligent Map Interface**  
- **Dual View Modes**: Grid list + Interactive map synchronization (users switch seamlessly)[1][14]  
- **Dynamic Filtering**:  
  - Radius slider (default 2km, up to 50km) with heatmap overlay for activity density  
  - Activity type filters (adventure, social, fitness) with custom tags  
  - Skill level indicators (beginner-friendly to expert-only)[3][12]  
- **Smart Clustering**: Auto-group nearby activities into numbered clusters that expand on zoom[1][16]  
- **Privacy Layers**:  
  - Approximate location (200m radius circle) until join approval[17][20]  
  - Exact GPS pin revealed only to approved participants[13][17]  

### 2. **Activity Listings Engine**  
- **Rich Cards**:  
  - Host reputation badge (based on past reviews)  
  - Real-time participant gender ratio & age distribution  
  - Dynamic pricing (free/paid) & equipment requirements[3][6]  
- **AI-Powered Sorting**:  
  - Relevance score combining distance, host rating, and user preferences  
  - "Trending Nearby" section using collaborative filtering[1][8]  
- **Persistent Search States**: Remember filters/map position across sessions[14][18]  

---

## II. Activity Lifecycle Management (Playo-inspired)  
### 1. **Hosting Workflow**  
- **Smart Prefills**: Auto-detect location via GPS + manual map pin adjustment[20]  
- **Advanced Settings**:  
  - Join approval modes: Auto-approve/Manual review[5][13]  
  - Skill-based gating (e.g., "5K run <30min pace required")[3][11]  
  - Equipment checklist for participants[3][6]  
- **Co-Host System**: Assign co-organizers with equal management rights[11]  

### 2. **Join Request Pipeline**  
- **Tiered Participation**:  
  - Spectator mode (view-only access)  
  - Waitlist management with priority levels[5][7]  
- **Instant Notifications**: Push/webhook alerts for new requests/approvals[9]  
- **Anti-Spam Measures**:  
  - Profile completeness checks before allowing requests  
  - Request rate limiting per user[15]  

---

## III. Social & Communication Layer  
### 1. **Activity-Centric Chat**  
- **Pre-Event Channels**:  
  - Logistics thread (location, gear, transport)  
  - Social icebreakers (interest-based topics)[9][12]  
- **Post-Event Persistence**:  
  - Chat archives available for 72hrs post-activity  
  - Photo sharing gallery with EXIF stripping[9][11]  
- **Moderation Tools**:  
  - Host kick/ban privileges  
  - Automated profanity filters[9]  

### 2. **Reputation Ecosystem**  
- **Multi-Aspect Ratings**:  
  - Punctuality  
  - Skill level accuracy  
  - Equipment reliability  
  - Social behavior[3][11]  
- **Verified Skill Badges**:  
  - Platform-certified (e.g., "Wilderness First Aid Trained")  
  - Peer-endorsed (e.g., "10+ Rock Climbing Partners")[3][8]  

---

## IV. Unique Value-Add Features  
### 1. **Safety Systems**  
- **Auto-Checkins**: GPS confirmation when arriving at activity location  
- **Emergency Protocols**:  
  - SOS button with nearby hospital/police directions  
  - Automated checkup if activity extends beyond scheduled time[20]  

### 2. **Gamification Layer**  
- **Activity Streaks**: Bonus karma points for weekly participation[11]  
- **Skill Progression Trees**: Unlock badges/achievements across activity types[3]  
- **Local Leaderboards**: Neighborhood-level ranking by hosted/joined activities[11]  

### 3. **Monetization Ready**  
- **Integrated Payments**:  
  - Host-set pricing with platform commission  
  - Deposit system for equipment rentals[6][12]  
- **Sponsorship Slots**:  
  - Local business promotions in activity feeds  
  - Branded gear lending programs[6][8]  

---

## V. Technical Differentiators  
- **Offline-First Maps**: Cache recent map tiles & activity data[14][16]  
- **Predictive Load Balancing**: Anticipate surge areas (parks on weekends) to pre-cache data[1][10]  
- **Accessibility Suite**:  
  - Screen reader optimized activity cards  
  - Haptic feedback for map interactions[18]  

**Implementation Tips**:  
- Use MapLibre GL with OpenStreetMap vector tiles for cross-platform consistency[1]  
- Implement Redis for real-time join request queuing[5][7]  
- Apply XGBoost model for personalized activity recommendations[6][8]  

This feature set combines Airbnb's polished discovery experience with Playo's social depth, while introducing innovative safety and engagement layers. The architecture supports scaling from local community use to city-wide deployments.
